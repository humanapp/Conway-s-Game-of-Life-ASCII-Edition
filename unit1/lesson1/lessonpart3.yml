title: Applying Game of Life Rules
content: |
  **Goal:** Write logic to evolve the grid.

  **Concepts covered:**

  * If/else branching

  * Game logic

  * Cloning grids

  *Challenge:* Modify the rules and observe different behaviors.

        content: Which concept is essential for writing logic to evolve the grid in
          Conway's Game of Life?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: If/else branching
            explanation: If/else branching is used to implement the game logic for evolving
              the grid.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Looping through lists
            explanation: While looping is important, the question specifically asks about
              evolving logic, which relies on if/else branching.
          - id: "3"
            value: User input handling
            explanation: User input handling is not directly related to evolving the grid in
              Conway's Game of Life.
