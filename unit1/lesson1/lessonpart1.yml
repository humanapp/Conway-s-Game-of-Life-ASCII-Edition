  **Goal:** Define and display a 2D grid in the terminal.

  **Concepts introduced:**

  * 2D lists

  * Loops

  * Functions

  * Ternary expressions

  Change some cells to `1` manually to see a pattern.

        content: Reflect on how 2D lists, loops, and functions can be used together to
          define and display a grid in the terminal. How do these concepts
          contribute to the initial setup of Conway's Game of Life, and what
          challenges might arise when manually changing cells to '1' to see a
          pattern?

            explanation: 2D lists provide a structured way to represent the grid in the
              terminal.
