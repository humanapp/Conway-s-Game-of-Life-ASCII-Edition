title: Updating Cells
content: >
  **Goal:** Count live neighbors of a cell.


  **Concepts covered:**


  * Nested loops


  * Bounds checking


  * Grid navigation


  *Challenge:* Try counting neighbors for different positions (corners, edges,
  center).

        content: Which of the following is essential for correctly counting live
          neighbors in a grid using nested loops?
        options:
          - id: "1"
            value: Ensuring bounds checking to avoid accessing out-of-range indices.
            explanation: Bounds checking prevents errors by ensuring indices are within the
              grid limits.
            isCorrect: true
          - id: "2"
            value: Using a single loop to iterate over the grid.
            explanation: A single loop is insufficient for navigating a 2D grid.
          - id: "3"
            value: Ignoring cells on the grid edges.
            explanation: Ignoring edge cells would lead to incorrect neighbor counts.
